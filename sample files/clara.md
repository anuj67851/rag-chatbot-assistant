Clara Montgomery was born and raised in the coastal town of Astoria, Oregon, where she developed a deep love for the natural world at an early age. Growing up near the Pacific Ocean, Clara spent much of her childhood exploring the beaches, forests, and rivers of the Pacific Northwest. Her early exposure to the fragile beauty of these ecosystems sparked an interest in environmental issues, which would shape her career in the years to come.

After graduating as valedictorian from Astoria High School, Clara went on to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Studies at the University of Washington. During her time at the university, she became involved in various environmental activism groups, organizing clean-up events and campaigns to promote renewable energy. Her commitment to sustainability was further solidified when she participated in a semester-long research project studying the effects of deforestation in Southeast Asia, a project that earned her a coveted research assistantship.

Clara’s academic excellence and growing passion for environmental issues led her to pursue a Master’s degree in Environmental Science at Stanford University. At Stanford, she specialized in sustainable resource management and climate change science, developing a comprehensive thesis on the impact of urbanization on local ecosystems. Her research not only garnered attention within the academic community but also led to her first professional collaborations with environmental organizations.
Early Career

Upon completing her Master's degree, Clara was recruited by a renowned environmental research institute based in Seattle, where she spent five years as a senior researcher. Her role involved conducting large-scale studies on the environmental impact of industrial practices, particularly in the fields of agriculture, mining, and manufacturing.

In her time at the institute, Clara became known for her ability to combine scientific rigor with practical solutions. She worked with local governments to develop policies that incentivized businesses to adopt greener technologies and reduce carbon emissions. Her most notable project was a collaboration with a local municipality to create a sustainable waste management program, which reduced the city's landfill waste by 30% in just two years.

Clara’s reputation as a skilled environmental scientist grew rapidly, and in 2015, she made the decision to transition into sustainability consulting, believing that she could have a broader impact by helping organizations directly implement sustainable practices.
